# Platform Science Code Exercise
Author: James Totah

## How to run this program
* First clone the git repo to the user's local machine with JDK installed.
* Open a terminal and navigate to the repository you just cloned.
* In the console, type: 
    - javac Main.java
    - java Main
* The program should now be running in the terminal. It will prompt the user for the filepath to the drivers file and the destinations file.
* There are two small test files included in this repository, so when prompted, simply entering drivers.txt and destinations.txt will work.
* The output will be the matched drivers and destinations based on total suitability scores calculated using the definitions in the instruction pdf.
